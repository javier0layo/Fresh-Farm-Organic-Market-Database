The conceptual data model contains seven entities which form six different relationships between the entities. 
b
Maximum cardinality: One-to-Many (1: N) = > A CUSTOMER can have one or many SALES_ORDERs, but each SALES_ORDER belongs to only one CUSTOMER.
Minimum cardinality: Mandatory-to-Optional(M:O) = > A SALES_ORDER must have a CUSTOMER, but a CUSTOMER does not need to be associated to a SALES ORDER.
SALES_ORDER and ORDER_ITEM
Maximum cardinality: One-to-Many (1: N) = > A SALES_ORDER can have one or more ORDER_ITEMs. But each ORDER_ITEM is associated with only one SALES_ORDER.
Minimum cardinality: Mandatory-to-Optional(M:O) = > A SALES_ORDER must contain at least one ORDER_ITEM, but an ORDER_ITEM might not be associated with any SALES_ORDER.
ORDER_ITEM and PRODUCT
Maximum cardinality: One-to-Many (1: N) = > An ORDER_ ITEM can only represent a single PRODUCT, but a PRODUCT can appear in multiple ORDER_ITEMS across many SALES_ORDERs. 
Minimum Cardinality: Mandatory-to-Optional(M:O) = > An ORDER_ITEM must have a PRODUCT, but a PRODUCT might not be included in any ORDER_ITEMs. 
PRODUCT and CATEGORY
Maximum cardinality: One-to-Many (1: N) = > Each PRODUCT belongs to a single CATEGORY, but each CATEGORY can include multiple PRODUCTs.
Minimum cardinality: Mandatory-to-Many (M: M) = > Each PRODUCT must belong to at least one CATEGORY, and each CATEGORY must include at least one PRODUCT. 
PRODUCT and SUPPLIERS
Maximum cardinality: One-to-Many (1: N) = > Each PRODUCT is supplied by a single SUPPLIER. But a SUPPLIER can supply multiple PRODUCTs. 
Minimum cardinality: Mandatory-to-Many (M: N) = > Each PRODUCT must have one SUPPLIER and each SUPPLIER must have at least one PRODUCT. 
CUSTOMER and LOYALTY_PROGRAM
Maximum cardinality: One-to-One (1: 1) = > A CUSTOMER can participate in the LOYALTY_PROGRAM; and each LOYALTY_PROGRAM is associated with only one CUSTOMER. 
Minimum cardinality: Optional-to-Many(O:M) = > A CUSTOMER does not have to participate in the LOYALTY_PROGRAM, but a LOYALTY_PROGRAM must have at least one CUSTOMER. 

The logical and physical model of the database displays six different relationships between the seven tables. 
CUSTOMER and SALES_ORDER
The parent table is CUSTOMER and CustomerID is the primary key. SALES_ORDER is the child table with the foreign key CustomerID which references CustomerID in CUSTOMER. 
SALES_ORDER and ORDER_ITEM
The parent table is SALES_ORDER, and the primary key is SalesOrderID. The child table is ORDER_ITEM the foreign key is SalesOrderID which references SalesOrderID in SALES_ORDER. ORDER_ITEM has the primary key of OrderItemID.
ORDER_ITEM and PRODUCT
The parent table is PRODUCT, and the primary key is ProductID. The child table is ORDER_ITEM, and the foreign key is ProductID which references ProductID in PRODUCT.
PRODUCT and CATEGORY
The parent table is CATEGORY, and the primary key is CategoryID. The child table is PRODUCT, and the foreign key is CategoryID which references CategoryID in CATEGORY.
PRODUCT and SUPPLIER
The parent table is SUPPLIER, and the primary key is SupplierID. The child table is PRODUCT, and the foreign key is SupplierID which references SupplierID in SUPPLIER.
CUSTOMER and LOYALTY_PROGRAM 
The parent table is CUSTOMER, and the primary key is CustomerID. LOYALTY_PROGRAM is the child table, and the foreign key is CustomerID which references CustomerID in CUSTOMER. LOYALTY_PROGRAM has a primary key of LoyaltyProgramID.
